Kernel setup
------------

The msr driver must be loaded to write to MSRs from ring 3.

$ insmod msr

The pce bit (bit 8) must be set in cr4 to use rdpmc from ring 3.
Build and load the driver before using the library.

$ cd cr4
$ make
$ insmod pceset.ko

Removing the driver clears the pce bit

$ rmmod pceset
